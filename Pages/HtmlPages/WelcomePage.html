“The whole stadium at Watford will go for us and we have to be 100% ready. As long as we are really ready to fight no one should worry. But there is a lot of work to do. Could I have wished for a better position going into these last 11 games? No. I would never have thought it possible but each one is really difficult. We don’t expect one easy game.”

West Ham remain in the relegation zone after seven league games without a win under Moyes, although their new manager was rightly encouraged by his team’s display at Anfield.

“I felt we had grown into the game and started to earn the right to play,” Moyes said. “We thought there were points there for us. There is a lot I want to improve. I thought in the main we did well but this wasn’t a big game for us. Neither was Man City. These were warm-ups. The big games start now. The players have been told that in the dressing room. We have to do something in these upcoming games.”</p>
